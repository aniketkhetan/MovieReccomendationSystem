The database used for the system is one created by MovieLens for educational purposses and consists of movies up until 2018 and an additional dataset of 25 million user reviews named reviews.csv

Since the files were too large to upload to a github repo, Please find a link attached to the download of the folder containing all datasets reequired to run the file.

Please note: It is important to have the files in the same folder as the code file or change the path in the code accordingly.

To easily be able to explore the movie recommendations, open the directory that contains the 'st_movierec.py' file in the terminal and run the following line

streamlit run st_movierec.py
